UPDATE:

Displays the bmi value when user has entered his details and depending on the value of the bmi code displays that if that person is over/under weight. And also suggests the type of foods that he needs to consume inorder to gain the right BMI. I am happy about the fact that my application is displaying the right bmi value and suggesting the diet according to that.
