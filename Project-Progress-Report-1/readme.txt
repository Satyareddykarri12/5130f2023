Created a starting page where user is asked to login or signup. After clicking signing/Logging up and filling the form user is redirected to a BMI page where the user is asked to Enter their height and weight and based on the data that they have entered user's BMI index is displayed on the screen. This is my first time using JavaScript to take input from user and calculating the BMI and displaying it on the screen. so i'm quite proud of it.
