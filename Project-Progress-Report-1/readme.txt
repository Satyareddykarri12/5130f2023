Created a starting page where user is asked to login or signup. After clicking signing/Logging up and filling the form user is redirected to a BMI page where the user is asked to Enter their height and weight and based on the data that they have entered user's BMI index is displayed on the screen. Images has been added and Internal Css has been used. Right now login and signup page just takes the details and doesn't store it anywhere. I will be connecting this project to the data base soon so that user details are stored in the database.
