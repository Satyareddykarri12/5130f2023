We have used the mysql database and xaamp as the server for this project. Made changes to the css and js script to enhance the user interface. Now the application is going to store the Detials of the user in the database such as name, password, email, phone number and the bmi. When user has logged into the application user is asked to enter the details of their height and weight and it is going to generate the bmi and suggest some diet plans and excessive plans. I am proud that our application is storing the user data in the database.
